<div>
<h3>2008 - 2014 Senior Scientist, BioGasol/Estibio</h3>
I have managed projects focusing on fermentation development, optimization and scaling processes. The job was a continuation of my previous employment at DTU. I was leading a group consisting of two academics and four technicians. My daily work was focused on planning experiments, managing laboratory and pilot facilities and overall maturing the fermentation technology to industrial scale.
